# My First Generated Password

## User Story
I have created my first random generated password using javascript. It was fun and it made me understand how to use Javascript more.
This was challenge for me, because Javascript is so different from CSS and HTML. Javascript is difficult for me, 
because building it from scratch and understanding the logic. I reviewed the lessons over and over to really understand it.
I startd to click with me, but still lost at some parts. Overall, I learned so much from my mistakes and how important it is
to stay organized, using comments, and pseudo coding.
